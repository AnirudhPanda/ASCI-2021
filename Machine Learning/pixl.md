## About Project

Our project PIXL recognizes Gun using Deep Learning.

Tech Stack- Python, VS code

## Progress::

● First week we worked on loading datasets only\
● this week we labeled the dataset to train the model\
● and we also worked on model i.e. Logistic Regression using sigmoid function, cost function gradient descent, learning rate.\
● and finally tested the accuracy of our model
