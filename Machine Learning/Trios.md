## About Project

In this project we are planning to create a website for an imaginary Real Estate Company. In that website, there would be a section that would predict prices of houses.
 We would ask the user to input some features such as how much area of land he/she needs, the number of rooms he/she wants in his/her house etc.

We would take those features and predict the prices of house through an ML Model, and once any user get's the predicted price of the house we would store all its values in our backend and that would
 be feeded to our chatbot which would then interact with the user and would give them different locations of houses for the user to buy. As well as if the user has any questions regarding the property that would be answered by the chatbot.

The main aim of adding chatbot feature to our website would be to communicate with the user and convince them to buy house from our company.

## First Week Work

Data loading and data cleaning was done in ML part. And in web part, login page was designed. Since the project is going to be based on 3 tier architecture the entity layer was 
made for house details. The entity layer is going to help in transfer of data between data access layer and business logic layer.

## Second Week Work

Analysis of various data features was done with respect to price using graphs and piecharts in ML part. In web development part, home page, signIn, login and house details entry page 
was designed. The backend was also designed. In backend, stored procedures were also made (in computer local server) for taking inputs and display of user details, city, place and country names. 
And entity layer for country, city, places and user was made and house details was updated.
