## About Project

Today, around one million people use American Sign Language as their mode of communication according to the Communication Service for the Deaf. Automated two way communication between sign language and text/speech is an unsolved problem globally.
We as a team are trying to tackle this issue by the use of Image Processing in real time, in which the machine sees the signs being made by a person and interprets it into the well-understood English language. The use of Computer Vision and Supervised Model Training make it a part of the 'Machine Learning' theme.

The tech stack used consists of OpenCV, Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow.

## Weekly Report
### Week 1
Configured all the required software and got past all the compatibility issues.<br>
Set up the image capture program to collect images for the dataset.
### Week 2
Labelled the collected images by applying bounding boxes to the hand symbols.<br>
Set up the pre-trained training model from TensorFlow GitHub repo, and set up some of the code required to alter the configuration of the pre-trained training model in order to match our requirements
