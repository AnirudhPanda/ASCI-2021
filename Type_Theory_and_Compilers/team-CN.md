## About Project

**Boa** is a static analysis tool for the Python programming language that works without needing
any type annotations. It performs flow sensitive type analysis and and is capable of inferring type 
information from code using [Hindley Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system) type inference and a [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)) algorithm.

This project attempts to demonstrate that better tooling is possible for dynamically typed languages without
needing an extra layer of traspilation with superset languages like [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [Flow](https://flow.org/).

As a bonus, Boa can compile python to native x86 machine code, boosting it's speed by some orders of magnitude.
Boa watches the filesystem for changes in source code and reports errors as soon as it encounters them.

**Tech stack**:

 - Python
 - C
 - x86 ASM
 - Numpy
 - WatchDog

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1
- Implemented Parsing, syntax analysis and basic type checking for primitive data types.
- Added a barebones framework for the Hindey Milner unification engine.

### Week 2
- Can now compile basic control flow structures down to assembly instructions.
- Added context sensitive type analysis.
- Implemented a high level IR that acts as a middle ground between the AST and the native machine code.
